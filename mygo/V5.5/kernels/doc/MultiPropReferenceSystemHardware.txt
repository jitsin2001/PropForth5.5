                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                             
Built a reference 3 prop system for testing:
All tutorials are designed for this configuration.

Propeller Prototype Board, 5 MHz 64kx8 eeprom.
40 Pin Dip prop chip  added to this board.
spinneret board connected to the Prototype board.

NOTE: the 220 ohm resistors are to limit current in the case of SW misgonfiguration, anything from about 100 - 400 ohms
is suitable. Any larger values will slow down the edges, and can cause problems with the serial and com drivers.

This part of the configuration allows for testing of the norom boot, the serial driver, and the com synchronous
communication driver.

Section 1 - hardware

1.1 Prototype Board or equivalent
Used a propeller protoboard @ 5 MHZ with a 64kx8 rom,
with a FTDI USB->rs232 attached to the header
This is the MASTER for MULTI-PROP configurations.

1.2 Bare prop chip
Used a 40 pin dip.  
This is the ROMLESS SLAVE for MULTI-PROP configurations.

1.3 Spineret board or equivalent
Used a Spinneret board.  w5100 + Protoboard is also an alternative.
This provides an example implementation of ETHERNET and SD services for the multi-prop configurations.

Section 2 - Connections

2.1 protoboard or equivalent

a. Connect propplug or equivalent to PC
b. Connect power

2.2 prop chip, used a 40 pin dip
HINT: DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP, IT WILL NOT WORK

a. Run power and ground 
b. connect 2 0.1 uF caps between the power and ground pins, close to the chip
c. connect 10k pullup resistor on  IO 29 - the pin normally hookup up to sda on the eeprom

2.3 Protoboard to 40pin DIP prop

a. Protoboard MASTER to ROMLESS Slave 

Protoboard -  intermediate components -  40Pin DIP Prop Chip	
IO 8       -> 220 ohm resistor        -> IO 28 (this pin normally hooks up to scl on the eeprom)
IO 9       -> 220 ohm resistor        -> IO 29 (this pin normally hooks up to sda on the eeprom, 10k pullup resistor as well)
IO 10      ->  plain jumper wire      -> RESET
IO 11      ->  plain jumper wire      -> XI

This is a serial port connection so we can talk to PropForth on the Prop Chip serially if we so choose

IO 0       -> 220 ohm resistor        -> IO 30
IO 1       -> 220 ohm resistor        -> IO 31

b. Protoboard to Spinneret board

These connections are made from the protoboard to the 4 pin J2 header on the Spinneret board.

HINT: Use a modular connector on the SPINNERET END of these connections;
we need to switch the connection and use the prop-plug to load the SPINNERET on some tests.
A) I used a dead IDE cable, and used six conductors from the ribbon cable, and DREMEL'd down the 
IDE connector into a 4 pin female connector and a 3 pin female connector. 
B) While I was at it, I also made an extra 3 pin female connector, and put it on a harvested 9v wall-wart.
This is for using a SPINNERET standalone, which is an option after executiong all the tests. 

Protoboard - intermediate components - Spinneret

IO 12	     -> 220 ohm resistor        -> J2:1 Tx IO 30 
IO 13      -> 220 ohm resistor        -> J2:2 Rx IO 31
IO 14	     ->  plain jumper wire      -> J2:3 RESET
GND        ->  plain jumper wire      -> J2:4 GND

These connections are made to the 3 pin J6 header on the Spinneret board from power.
NOTE: POWER can be a separate power supply or can be from the 5volt on the protoboard. 

Spinneret -> intermediate components -> power

J6:1         (not connected)
J6:2      ->   just a wire           -> 5 volts
J6:3      ->   just a wire           -> GND
