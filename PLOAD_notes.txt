PLOAD is an image load routine for the P8X32A Parallax Propeller chip.
This routine will load an executable binary image to the prop chip.
An executable image file is for example a compile spin file.
The pload routine is suitable as a replacement for the propellent.exe program, providing the code does not change.

PLOAD is part of the propgcc compiler package, but is subject to change.

These instructions worked in May 2016, and should be ok as this part of the code appears stable.
